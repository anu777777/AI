Frame based knowledge representation

class Frame:
    def __init__(self, name, slots):
        self.name = name
        self.slots = slots
    
    def get_slot_value(self, slot_name):
        if slot_name in self.slots:
            return self.slots[slot_name]
        else:
            return None
    
    def set_slot_value(self, slot_name, value):
        self.slots[slot_name] = value

# example frames
person_frame = Frame("Person", {"name": "John", "age": 30, "gender": "male"})
car_frame = Frame("Car", {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Camry", "year": 2018})

# accessing slot values
print(person_frame.get_slot_value("name"))  # outputs "John"
print(car_frame.get_slot_value("year"))  # outputs 2018

# modifying slot values
person_frame.set_slot_value("age", 40)
print(person_frame.get_slot_value("age"))  # outputs 40


In this example, Frame is a class that represents a frame or a concept in the knowledge base. 
A frame has a name and a set of slots, where each slot has a name and a value. 
The get_slot_value method returns the value of a given slot name, and the set_slot_value method sets the value of a given slot name. 
The example frames person_frame and car_frame represent a person and a car, respectively, and demonstrate how slots can be accessed and modified.
The above code that I provided is an implementation of a frame-based knowledge representation. 
In frame-based systems, knowledge is organized around objects or concepts known as "frames", which consist of a set of attributes or "slots" that describe the properties of the object. 
Frames can be used to represent a wide range of entities, such as objects, events, concepts, or processes.

In the code, the Frame class represents a frame, with the name attribute representing the name of the frame, and the slots attribute representing the slots associated with the frame. 
The get_slot_value and set_slot_value methods are used to get and set the values of the slots, respectively. Overall, this code implements a basic frame-based knowledge representation system.
